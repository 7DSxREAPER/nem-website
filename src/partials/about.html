This doesn’t sound like a big deal at first, but if one really takes a closer look at it, the advantages are significant. With other platforms, multisig has always been client or wallet based which means each implementation is not compatible across many different platforms, even if it is of the same crypto currency. This is not the case with NEM.</p>
    <p class="multisig2" data-i18n="[html]multisig2">Because multisignature accounts can be created, and transactions issued by using the API, it has suddenly become far simpler, to make use of multisignature technology. Furthermore, a client based multisig solution requires the wallet to be running. With NEM’s unique blockchain based solution for multisig, the NIS nodes handle the signing of a transaction. Hence, once a multisig transaction is created, the user can switch the client wallet offline.</p>
