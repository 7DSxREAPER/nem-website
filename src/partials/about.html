With other platforms, multisig has always been client or wallet based which means each implementation is not compatible across many different platforms, even if it is of the same crypto currency. This is not the case with NEM.</p>
    <p class="multisig2" data-i18n="[html]multisig2">Because multisignature accounts can be created, and transactions issued by using the API, it has suddenly become far simpler, to make use of multisignature technology. Furthermore, a client based multisig solution requires the wallet to be running. With NEM’s unique blockchain based solution for multisig, the NIS nodes handle the signing of a transaction. Hence, once a multisig transaction is created, the user can switch the client wallet offline.</p>

It is done by creating a safe secondary private key that is a delegate key. This delegate key is publicly (blockchain) mapped to the main account via a contract and inherits its importance score, but the delegated key has neither funds nor assets in it. This delegate private key can be given to another node and use its borrowed importance score to harvest. All fees earned will be transferred directly to the original account, so there is no way for the node owner to steal the fees.</p>
