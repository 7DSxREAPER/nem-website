All done safely and that other node doesn’t ever get to see any of the fee rewards even though it was the one that pushed the block to the network. It is done by creating a secondary private key that is a delegate key. This delegate key is publicly (blockchain) mapped to the main account and inherits its POI, but has no funds nor assets in it. This delegate private key can then use its borrowed POI to harvest. All fees earned will be transferred directly to the original account, so there is no way for the node to steal your harvested fees.",

Mosaics can be applied with a levy so that any mosaic being sent on the network will have to have a special fee paid above the normal fee paid in XEM. This levy fee can be assigned to be NEM.XEM or any other mosaic on the NEM blockchain.\n",

 "multisig": "NEM's multisig solution is “on blockchain”. This doesn’t sound like a big deal at first, but if one really takes a closer look at it, the advantages are significant. With other platforms, multisig has always been client or wallet based which means each implementation is not compatible across many different platforms, even if it is of the same crypto currency. This is not the case with NEM.",
 "multisig2": "Because multisignature accounts can be created, and transactions issued by using the API, it has suddenly become far simpler, to make use of multisignature technology. Furthermore, a client based multisig solution requires the wallet to be running. With NEM’s unique blockchain based solution for multisig, the NIS nodes handle the signing of a transaction. Hence, once a multisig transaction is created, the user can switch the client wallet offline.",
 "multisigTitle": "Multisig",
 "namespace": "Namespaces on the NEM system is a domain naming system, not unlike that of the internet. There are higher level domains and subdomains. This allows one person with one domain to create many different subdomains for their different projects or outside business accounts. It also helps to build and maintain a reputation system for Mosaic.",
 "namespace2": "A creator owning the root domain namespace can create as many sub-domains as wanted, using a convention similar to the Java namespace convention, i.e., separated by a dot \\\".\\\" to represent a domain or subdomain and an asterisk surrounded by a space on each side \\\" * \\\" to represent the name of an asset. This is the current internal convention in NIS and how it is represented later in the NIS and/or NCC UI might differ. This gives the creator a practically limitless number of mosaics that can be defined within a practically limitless number of sub-domains.\n",
 "namespace3": "The sub-levels of a namespace can act as the actual name of the asset, or in some cases can be a class of assets as it is itself a sub-domain with lots of assets under that sub-domain name.   This means that last part of a mosaic will always be the name of the individual asset on the NEM blockchain and the prior names will act as the domain and/or subdomain for that asset.\n",

Apart from NEM being another crypto currency, NEM is a solution platform. There is more to offer as a platform. As a crypto currency, it does not require a lot of computing power and energy to run a node. NEM also advocates low entry barrier by way of Proof of Importance (POI) instead of the traditional ones that require a lot of stakes or computing power to mine. In NEM we call it harvesting. In addition, it also uses another solution, called Eigentrust ++ to validate and sieve out bad actors in the network. As an evolving solution, NEM is setting the stage for better things to come.
