 "architecture": "Design of the solution is based on the NCC being one tier (i.e., client) and the NIS being the server tier. The NCC also has a webserver with useful APIs.\n",

 "blocktimes": "NEM’s target block time is 1 minute. Its average block time over 360 blocks is 60 ± 0.5 seconds.\n",

 "consensus": "\"Proof-of-Importance\" is the first reputation based blockchain algorithm that just doesn’t reward those that hold as much stake as possible without spending, or those that do work outside the system unrelated to it.\n",
 "consensus.title": "Consensus Mechanism",
 "consensus2": "NEM’s POI algorithm is determined by 3 factors. How much vested stake an account has, how much their net outflow is, and which accounts they are interacting with. This encourages accounts on the NEM blockchain to partake in transaction graph and be active accounts on the network.\n",
 "delegated": "This is harvesting (mining/forging) whereby another person’s node can be used to form blocks for your account. All done safely and that other node doesn’t ever get to see any of the fee rewards even though it was the one that pushed the block to the network. It is done by creating a secondary private key that is a delegate key. This delegate key is publicly (blockchain) mapped to the main account and inherits its POI, but has no funds nor assets in it. This delegate private key can then use its borrowed POI to harvest. All fees earned will be transferred directly to the original account, so there is no way for the node to steal your harvested fees.",

 "harvesting": "In NEM harvesting is the act of forming blocks (mining/forging). A harvester must have at least 10,000 vested XEM in their account and be running an active and synced node. Once a block is formed by that harvester, a new block is added to the chain and all the fees collected from that block will be delivered to the harvester’s account.\n",

 "messaging": "Messages can be sent along with transactions or by themselves. This can be done unencrypted/encrypted/hex formats depending on the user or programmers needs.\n",
 "messaging.title": "Messaging",
 "mosaic": "The mosaics themselves are customizable by amount in either a fixed, mutable, or capped quantity. They can be designed to be transferable or not, divisible or not, and can also be combined into groups as well as have descriptions, and be sent alongside encrypted messages in one transaction. Mosaics can be applied with a levy so that any mosaic being sent on the network will have to have a special fee paid above the normal fee paid in XEM. This levy fee can be assigned to be NEM.XEM or any other mosaic on the NEM blockchain.\n",
 "mosaic.title": "Mosaic",
 "mosaic2": "Mosaic’s current version is a unique, advanced and customizable asset creation feature with later versions planned to carry even more additional features.\n",
 "multisig": "NEM's multisig solution is “on blockchain”. This doesn’t sound like a big deal at first, but if one really takes a closer look at it, the advantages are significant. With other platforms, multisig has always been client or wallet based which means each implementation is not compatible across many different platforms, even if it is of the same crypto currency. This is not the case with NEM.",
 "multisig.title": "Multisig",
 "multisig2": "Because multisignature accounts can be created, and transactions issued by using the API, it has suddenly become far simpler, to make use of multisignature technology. Furthermore, a client based multisig solution requires the wallet to be running. With NEM’s unique blockchain based solution for multisig, the NIS nodes handle the signing of a transaction. Hence, once a multisig transaction is created, the user can switch the client wallet offline.",
 "namespace": "Namespaces on the NEM system is a domain naming system, not unlike that of the internet. There are higher level domains and subdomains. This allows one person with one domain to create many different subdomains for their different projects or outside business accounts. It also helps to build and maintain a reputation system for Mosaic.",
 "namespace.title": "Namespace",
 "namespace2": "A creator owning the root domain namespace can create as many sub-domains as wanted, using a convention similar to the Java namespace convention, i.e., separated by a dot \\\".\\\" to represent a domain or subdomain and an asterisk surrounded by a space on each side \\\" * \\\" to represent the name of an asset. This is the current internal convention in NIS and how it is represented later in the NIS and/or NCC UI might differ. This gives the creator a practically limitless number of mosaics that can be defined within a practically limitless number of sub-domains.\n",
 "namespace3": "The sub-levels of a namespace can act as the actual name of the asset, or in some cases can be a class of assets as it is itself a sub-domain with lots of assets under that sub-domain name.   This means that last part of a mosaic will always be the name of the individual asset on the NEM blockchain and the prior names will act as the domain and/or subdomain for that asset.\n",
 "ncc": "The “NEM Community Client” is the NEM wallet software. Any wallet is capable of interacting with any NIS node on the network safely and securely to make transactions.\n",
 "ncc.title": "NCC",
 "newcode": "NEM developers built NEM from scratch. It is not a fork of any other project. It was built with Test Driven Development, and has been built in mind to be easy for other developers to be able to easily build on top of with any JSON compatible language with NEM’s easy to use APIs. NEM’s blockchain was reenvisioned from scratch with the goal to be a flexible and modular chain that was secure and stable. Because of this new code, new style of development and new vision, NEM’s chain can now support a wide range of features and security protocols not ever implemented in other platforms.\n",
 "newcode.title": "100% New Code",
 "nis": "The “NEM Infrastructure Server” is the backbone of the NEM network. It is installed on decentralized nodes throughout the internet making it stable and secure. It is used to relay and process transactions.",
 "nis.title": "NIS",
 "reputation": "Eigentrust++ is a security clustering algorithm so nodes can give reputation to their neighbors in clusters, making it very difficult for a node to give false information consistently to the network. Only nodes that have consistently performed well in the past giving verifiable correct information are given a good reputation and have their data acknowledged.\n",

 "sec": "Open the Full Featured NEM Beta Client in your web browser, a simple two step process.",
 "spam": "Spam Protection - NEM uses localized spam protection. It is activated after all blocks have reached full capacity and only the accounts producing spam are affected. The spamming accounts have their transactions fees increasingly raised in relation to the spam they produce. They therefore can still spam, but it increasingly costs more in proportion to their spam volume. Other accounts in the network keep their low transaction costs.\n",
